Design System: "Vertex"
Theme: Precision, Futurism, High-Performance.

1. Core Philosophy
The 60-30-10 Rule:

60% (Backgrounds): Deep Blacks and Charcoals.

30% (Content/Typography): Whites and Cool Greys.

10% (Accents): Electric Green (Used only for Call-to-Actions and key highlights).

Whitespace: Massive breathing room. The content should feel like it is floating.

Geometry: Sharp edges mixed with subtle rounding (4px radius) to suggest software engineering precision.

2. Color Palette
This palette relies on high contrast to create a "modern" impact.

A. Primary (The "Exceptional" Accent)

Name: Terminal Green

Hex: #00FF94 (A bright, neon mint)

Usage: Primary buttons, hyperlinks, cursor accents, and data visualization lines.

Psychology: Represents growth, code execution, and energy.

B. Neutrals (The "Clean" Base)

Surface Black: #0A0A0A (Main background - slightly softer than pure black).

Card Black: #141414 (Secondary background for cards/sections).

Stroke Grey: #333333 (Subtle borders for separation).

C. Typography Colors

Display White: #FFFFFF (Headlines).

Body Grey: #B0B0B0 (Paragraphs - reduces visual vibration against black).

3. Typography
To look "modern," we will pair a character-rich geometric font with a highly legible functional font.

A. Headings (Display)

Font: Space Grotesk (or Syne for something more artistic).

Characteristics: Monospaced qualities, wide stance, geometric.

Weights: Bold (700) for H1/H2; Medium (500) for H3.

Tracking: Tight (-2% letter spacing) to make headlines feel compact and solid.

B. Body (Functional)

Font: Inter (or Satoshi).

Characteristics: Tall x-height, extremely readable on screens.

Weights: Regular (400) for body; Semi-Bold (600) for navigation.

Line Height: 1.6 (Open line height to enhance the "clean" feeling).

4. UI Component Library
Buttons
Primary Button (CTA):

Background: Terminal Green (#00FF94).

Text: Surface Black (#0A0A0A) - Bold.

Shape: Sharp corners or very slight radius (2px).

Interaction: On hover, the button slides up 2px with a hard shadow.

Secondary Button:

Background: Transparent.

Border: 1px Solid Display White.

Text: Display White.

Cards (Services/Testimonials)
Background: Card Black (#141414).

Border: 1px solid #222222.

Hover Effect: No shadow. Instead, the border color transitions to Terminal Green on hover. This mimics a "circuit" connecting.

Input Fields
State (Default): Dark background (#1A1A1A), no border, bottom line only (#333333).

State (Active): Bottom line turns Terminal Green.

5. Visual Effects & Textures
A. The "Glow"

Do not use flat colors only. Use a radial gradient of the Terminal Green at 5% opacity behind major images or headlines. This creates a "cinematic" lighting effect in the dark mode.

B. Grid Lines

Use a very subtle background pattern of vertical lines (Color #1A1A1A) spanning the height of the page. This reinforces the "Software Architecture" vibe.

C. Imagery Style

Photography: Black and white photography of people/teams, but with the background cut out or darkened.

Graphics: Minimalist wireframes or code snippets syntax-highlighted in Green and White.

6. Layout Principles
Asymmetry: Don't center everything. Use a strong left alignment for text, balancing it with large negative space or imagery on the right.

Glassmorphism (Optional): For the navigation bar, use a backdrop blur (blur(10px)) with a 50% opacity black background to let content scroll smoothly underneath.
